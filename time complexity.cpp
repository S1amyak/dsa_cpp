time complexity
constant time - O(1)        ---like in for loop 1 to 10 is range
linear time - O(n)          ---like in for loop 1 to n is range
logarithmic time - O(log n) --- binary search 
quadratic time - O(n^2)     ---- 2 for loop with range 1 to n 
cubic time - O(n^3)         --- 3 for loop with range 1 to n
